# DEVROCKETS


This is the DEVROCKETS project, develop for Adalab web development course, by [Ana Apezteguía](https://github.com/anaapezteguia), [Sagra Mielgo](https://github.com/sagramielgo) and [Marcjanna Stopinska](https://github.com/marcjnn) and myself, Ana Bescós. The objective was to create a web page, from a given design, applying the knowledge acquired during this module of the course, which are the following: 
Layout: HTML5, CSS3, Flexbox, CSS Grid, SASS.

We have also added transitions and some small changes authorised by the Product Owner.

We started working on HTML and CSS, and then migrated the project to our Adalab Starter Kit. On the other hand, we have used branches, to be able to work simultaneously avoiding code conflicts.

You can access the web from the link attached on Github Pages.
